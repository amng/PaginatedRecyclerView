## Paginated Recycler View

Current version: 0.0.1

This library allows the use of a recycler view with pagination, keeping only a specified number
of pages and elements per page that is defined by the application. This way there will never be more than
the specified number of elements (number of pages * number of elements per page) in memory.

Dependencies: [Malinskiy SuperRecyclerView](https://github.com/Malinskiy/SuperRecyclerView)
